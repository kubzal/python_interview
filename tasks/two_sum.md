# Two Sum

The **Two Sum** problem is a popular coding challenge that tests your ability to use basic data structures and algorithms. The problem asks you to find two numbers in a given list that add up to a specific target sum.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example

```python
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

```python
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
```

```python
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
```
